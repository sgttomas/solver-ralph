# SR-APPLICABILITY v0.1.0-draft.1 — Notes

This draft was created to house the “orientation + applicability” discussion as a governed, directional document.

- Contains the provided overview (Section 1) as the canonical high-signal orientation.
- Separates “what it is” from “when to use it” (problem signatures vs anti-signatures).
- Keeps metaphors explicitly non-normative.
- Avoids introducing new requirements; binding remains in SR-CONTRACT / SR-SPEC / SR-CHANGE / SR-DIRECTIVE.
