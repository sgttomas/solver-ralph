# Step 3 — Portal Playbooks (filled)

## Artifacts produced
- `portal_playbook__ExceptionApprovalPortal_filled.md`
- `portal_playbook__GovernanceChangePortal_filled.md`
- `portal_playbook__ReleaseApprovalPortal_filled.md`

## Alignment note
To honor the constraint “only complete playbooks from the 3 seeded portal documents”, additional logical needs (ENG_ACCEPT, budget escalation, oracle suite/profile changes, portal policy changes) are represented as **request types within these 3 portals**, rather than requiring additional portal playbooks.
