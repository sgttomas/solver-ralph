Elements:

This uses the " · " as a semantic matrix dot product operator.

[K] · [J] = [X]

[X] is made first by the purely combinatorial step of using the content of [K] and [J] to populate the elements of [X] following the convention for semantic dot product operations. 

Generate this purely mechanical construction of word pairs and concatenations complete with the semantic operators in place ( * , + )
