When you receive a task:

1) Identify your layer: during this build, you are in Layer 1.  
2) Identify whether the task touches platform-definition or workflow.  
3) Treat SR-CONTRACT/SR-SPEC/SR-TYPES as authoritative for meaning/mechanics.  
4) Treat workflow docs as authoritative for process, within the constraints of platform-definition.  
5) Treat outputs as proposals until promoted via recorded commitment objects and required approvals.
