 Read and internalized key SR-* documents:
  - SR-README - Project status, recent sessions
  - SR-CHARTER - Platform scope, authority model, milestones
  - SR-TYPES - Type registry, domain types, configuration types
  - SR-AGENTS - Agent constraints, actor kinds, work envelopes
  - SR-WORK-SURFACE - Intake schema, procedure templates, work surface instances
  - SR-SPEC - Event model, state machines, API endpoints, DB schemas
  - SR-EVENT-MANAGER - Projection computation, eligibility predicates
  - SR-PROCEDURE-KIT - Stage-gated procedure templates



 Loops are the core component of this platform.  They are the thing upon which all the adapters and ports are    
  operating.  They need to be specified in detail.  Read the project documents SR-* as appropriate and then       
  create a comprehensive and detailed plan to create a fully functional "loops" page that gives the user          
  visibility to and configuration of where possible all the attributes that make up a loop and that are produced  
  by a loop. 
  
  Workflows are a special type of context that's provided by the user to the agent to
  tell it what it's going to do.  Protocols are a special type of context that's provided by the user to the agent
  to tell it how it's going to approach the problem.  They are exemplified in the SR-PLAN and SR-DIRECTIVE
  governance documents that you have access to in docs/program/ . Your task is to review those SR- 


are any of the templates created yet?  Such as for protocols, or workflows, or oracles
