## feedback and clarification of ralph-loops
That makes sense!  Thank you for clarifying.  This is an extremely important part to get right.  This is the heart of the entire matter: loops.  
You've shown an iterative pattern, but we actually want one degree further and implement a recursive pattern (of a particular type).  
At the end of each Ralph Loop's attempt at the problem when reaching the hooks (what do we call the things that inhibit further loop action?) that agent MUST DO:
1. Go back and read docs/charter/SR-README.md  and based on our dev session today is it necessary to revise any of the canonical documents (SR-*) in accordance with their intended purpose?  If so, make the necessary updates (but only what's necessary)
2. Summarize the dev session and update the SR-README accordingly
3. Write the prompt for the next instance of yourself if the task wasn't completed. Otherwise
4. Git add && commit && push
Then begin the next iteration with the newly revised SR-README being called into context as the in

## Additional feedback
to me, the Prompts ( /prompts ) page is an attempt at implementing the "Intakes" 
We should change that page to be called "Intakes" and then structure it and give it functionality accordingly
Instead of "Context" we should have a page for "References".  The existing Context page may be an early attempt you can build on, or not. 

## Proposal
Evaluate these recommendations against your understanding.  Your perspective takes precedence, these are just recommendations.  Explain your perspective on the matter.
