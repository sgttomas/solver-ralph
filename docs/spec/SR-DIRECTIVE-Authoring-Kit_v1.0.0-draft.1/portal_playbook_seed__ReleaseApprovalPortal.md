# ReleaseApprovalPortal — Playbook (seed)

Human-only binding boundary for release/freeze: approve a specific candidate state for baseline/shippable progression.

Complete this using `portal_playbook_template.md`.

- **portal_id:** `ReleaseApprovalPortal`
- **Primary membranes enforced:** Authority & Integrity; Accountability; Operational
- **Critical rule:** approvals MUST be bound to evidence and candidate identity; no “approval by narrative”
