CHG-G-00,Frontmatter,Frontmatter schema + identity,"Frontmatter includes solver_ralph.schema, id, type, version, status, authority_kind, governed_by, refs.",Confirm YAML frontmatter parses and required keys are present; confirm version matches file name.,PASS,Basic keys found.,,,,,
CHG-G-01,0 / Version changes,Version changes section present,Document includes a Version changes section describing what changed in this version.,Check §0 exists and enumerates deltas for v1.3.0-draft.1.,PASS,Found §0 and §0.1.,,,,,
CHG-G-10,3.1,Minimum instantiated portal IDs defined,"Defines minimum instantiated portal IDs: GovernanceChangePortal, ReleaseApprovalPortal, ExceptionApprovalPortal.",Verify §3.1 contains the three portal IDs exactly; confirm instance portal set satisfies this.,FAIL,Extracted minimum portals: (none found),,,,,
CHG-G-11,3.2,Portal-function aliasing rule is explicit and bounded,Permits portal-function aliasing without changing binding semantics; requires explicit request typing + attributable human approval + evidence refs.,Read §3.2; ensure it constrains aliasing (no semantic changes) and requires explicit records.,PASS,Found aliasing section/header.,,,,,
CHG-G-12,3.3,Routing matrix covers required change kinds and portal functions,"Routing matrix exists and includes (at minimum) governance change, current selection change, oracle suite change, exception change, phase gate, budget extension, release approval.",Inspect §3.3 table; ensure required rows exist and notes do not permit silent bypass.,PASS,Table header found; required keywords checked.,,,,,
CHG-G-20,5.1,Freeze manifest completeness,Freeze artifact_manifest[] includes canonical governed set (and versions in force).,Confirm §5.1 specifies canonical governed set inclusion; confirm canonical set enumerated in metadata / text.,PASS,Found freeze manifest requirement language.,,,,,
CHG-G-21,5.2,Instance inputs included in freeze for replayability,"If instance uses SR-PLAN + directive-owned control surfaces, Freeze MUST include SR-PLAN instance + SR-DIRECTIVE + control surfaces (Gate Registry / Profile Definitions / Portal Playbooks).","Confirm §5.2 contains bullets for SR-PLAN instance, SR-DIRECTIVE, and control surfaces.",PASS,"Checked for SR-PLAN, SR-DIRECTIVE, and control surface keywords.",,,,,
CHG-G-30,6.2 / 7.1,Non-waivable integrity conditions complete,"Non-waivable list includes ORACLE_TAMPER, ORACLE_ENV_MISMATCH, ORACLE_GAP, ORACLE_FLAKE, EVIDENCE_MISSING.",Verify §6.2 and/or §7.1 includes these items and states they are not eligible for Gate Waiver.,PASS,All required tokens present.,,,,,
CHG-G-31,7.2,No silent oracle weakening,Required↔Advisory or environment constraint changes must be explicitly routed/approved; cannot be implicit.,Confirm §7.2 states explicit routing/approval and forbids silent weakening.,PASS,Found §7.2 heading; checked for required/advisory language.,,,,,
CHG-G-40,8.1 / 8.2,Decision record triggers and routing,Defines when Decision records are required and how they route via portal function to instance portal IDs (with aliasing allowed).,"Confirm §8.1 lists required cases (stop triggers, budget extension, phase gates, proceed anyway) and §8.2 defines routing.",PASS,Found decision record requirement language and §8.2 heading.,,,,,
CHG-G-50,9,Emergency change procedure defined,Defines emergency change workflow including later ratification/audit and required records/evidence.,Review §9; confirm it cannot bypass integrity constraints and still produces required records.,PASS,Found §9 heading.,,,,,
CHG-G-60,10,Self-amendment constraints (SR-CHANGE bootstrapping),"Defines how SR-CHANGE can amend itself safely, including approvals and versioning.",Review §10; ensure it requires explicit approval and does not allow silent updates.,PASS,Found §10 heading.,,,,,
CHG-G-70,Instance compatibility,3-portal instance compatibility,"If an instance only instantiates GovernanceChangePortal/ReleaseApprovalPortal/ExceptionApprovalPortal, SR-CHANGE must still be satisfiable via portal-function aliasing for OracleSuiteChange/PhaseGate/BudgetExtension/Decision.",Confirm §3.1 minimum is three portals and §3.2 aliasing allows additional portal functions to be routed through existing portals without semantics loss.,WARN,Minimum portals ok; aliasing keyword present.,,,,,
