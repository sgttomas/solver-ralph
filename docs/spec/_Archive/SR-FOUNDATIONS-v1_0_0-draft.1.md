SR-FOUNDATIONS v1.0.0-draft.1

0. Summary (the one-paragraph version)

1. What SOLVER-Ralph Is
   - The core proposition
   - Two coupled representations (meaning/mechanism)
   - Not an agent framework; a truth-maintenance system

2. The Foundational Triad
   - Agents = variation (proposers)
   - Oracles + Gates = selection (evidence + admissibility)  
   - Portals + Humans = binding (authority + responsibility)

3. What Agents Are
   - Defined by non-authority, not capability
   - Uniform ontology; variability in work envelopes
   - [Reference SR-AGENTS for operational detail]

4. Membranes: Where Meaning Becomes Admissible
   - Generalized boundaries beyond code architecture
   - Fluid meaning → durable meaning
   - Structural blocking, not prohibition

5. The Semantic Valley
   - Typed manifold of admissible moves
   - Coherence becomes the easy path
   - Loop as semantic geometry

6. Epistemic Modes
   - Expansion: search, explore, hypothesize
   - Coalescence: verify, select, bind
   - Agents participate in both; never own coalescence

7. First-Class Commitments
   - Epistemology: evidence beats narrative
   - Authority: explicit, attributable, recorded
   - Operational control: governed surfaces (budgets, triggers, profiles, gates, playbooks)
   - Change management: inside the system, not outside

8. Hexagonal Architecture as Enforcement
   - Not style; how membranes become enforceable
   - Domain core holds semantics; ports are coercion points

9. The Canonical Workflow Shape
   - End-to-end loop structure
   - Agent output alone is never the terminal step

10. When to Use SOLVER-Ralph
    - Applicability criteria (structurable, typeable, verifiable, authority-requiring, stakes-worthy)
    - When NOT to use it
    - Core criterion: when "agent said so" is insufficient warrant

11. What Distinguishes SOLVER-Ralph
    - Comparison table vs other agentic approaches
