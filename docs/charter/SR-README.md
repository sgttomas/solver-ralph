# SR-README

Canonical index for the SR-* document set. This document contains **only** path mappings and linking conventions.

For precedence rules, see SR-TYPES §2.3.

---

## Cross-document reference convention

When referencing another SR-* document:

- Use the **doc_id** (e.g., `SR-CONTRACT`, `SR-SPEC`)
- Resolve to physical path using the table below
- If multiple candidates exist (duplicates, forks, renamed copies), treat this table as authoritative and record any deviation via SR-EXCEPTIONS
